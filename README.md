This is the github repository for the practical part of the exam.

## Explanations

### Scrolling Textures

I used two scrolling textures one for th water animation and the other was for the grass animation. Both the scrolling textures were made using the same code but with altered values to the tilling and different textures found online

### Color Correction

Color Correction was used to make the back wall and the roof look a lot more white then they would have due to the color Grading that i also added as a bonus 

### Extra Shaders 

The extra sahder i added was the tooon ramp plus a rim lighting to the player, this helps the player stand out more so they user does not lose track of where they are
